# Handle incoming notifications: Flutter

Beams makes it possible trigger callback code in your application when a push notification arrives on a user's device. This can be used to respond to the arrival of the notification in your application.

## Handle all notifications

You can implement a service to handle incoming notifications. It will get called when your application is in the foreground.

```dart
PusherBeams.instance.onMessageReceivedInTheForeground((notification) => print(notification));
```
